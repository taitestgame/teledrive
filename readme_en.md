**TeleCloud** is a project that allows you to use Telegram’s nearly unlimited storage capacity to store and manage files. Completely rewritten in Golang for excellent performance and low memory usage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Changed since version 3.7.0**
> Starting from v3.7.0, **App ID & API Hash** and **Bot Tokens (Bot Pool)** are no longer configured in the `.env` file — everything is managed directly inside the **application's Settings UI**:
> - 🔑 **App ID & API Hash**: During the initial setup, **just leave it as default and click Continue** — the app already has the developer credentials built in. Only change this if you are an **advanced user / developer** who wants to use their own API credentials.
> - 🤖 **Bot Tokens (Bot Pool)**: Add, edit, or remove bots directly in **Admin Panel → Settings → Bot Pool** — no server restart required.
